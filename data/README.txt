This project uses the Flickr500 dataset, which can be found here: 
https://www.cmlab.csie.ntu.edu.tw/project/Deep-Demosaic/static/dataset.zip

Extract these images into the Flickr500 directory; images in this directory will be used for training.

For validation data (in the Validation directory), add your own images, or take ~10 pictures from the training set and move them to the Validation directory.
